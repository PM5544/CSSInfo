# CSSInfo

Client side library to show stats about CSS styles on the current page (think of it as http://cssstats.com/ in the front end).

It can show unused or redundant styles, visualise some metrics, give feedback on what to improve
and show stats about highest specificity, longest selector and such.

A couple of libraries can work on styling files (sass/less/css) while developing but

I think such a lib would be nice since it can be used on live DOM and CSSOM in a browser so it can also hint about selector improvements and such.
